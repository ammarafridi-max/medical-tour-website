                Abdominoplasty, or tummy tuck, is a surgical procedure that
                removes excess fat and skin from the abdomen while tightening
                the abdominal muscles. It is commonly sought by individuals
                after significant weight loss or pregnancy to achieve a flatter,
                more toned midsection. The surgery can vary from a full to a
                mini tummy tuck, depending on the patientâ€™s needs.

                In addition to enhancing appearance, abdominoplasty can improve
                posture by strengthening the core muscles. While it offers
                long-lasting results, maintaining a healthy lifestyle is
                essential for sustaining those benefits. However, it's important
                to remember that this procedure is not a weight-loss solution.
